To use this component:

Add the file "SelectMultipleFilesCustomActivity" to the sources in manage packages and install the custom activity inside (Select Files)

If you want to use this component on your own invoices it will still work using specific fine tuning.

The component is using Regular Expressions to match data so it will still work on readable pdf files.

The Invoice identifier is directly substracted for the invoice file name, even if it's not a number it will be always detected.
